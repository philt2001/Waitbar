C# Waitbar
==========

This is a simple implementation of a C# waitbar in a separate window.
This is based on the Matlab waitbar and intended for a single threaded application (although not restricted to that).

The main file is Waitbar.cs. The remained of the files are a simple test bed for the waitbar.

It was created in Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express.
